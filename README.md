# autodone

The autodone service is under development and is intended to provide for Mastodon what autoChirp was for Twitter for a long time before API access was restricted.
The aim is to provide an automated scheduling service for Mastodon posts. The data to be posted can be collected and uploaded via spreadsheet tables.
