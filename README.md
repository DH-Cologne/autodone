# autodone

autodone is a service for the automated, time-controlled publication of status updates on any Mastodon instance. The codebase is developed under a free license by the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://dh.uni-koeln.de/) at the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/) and is open to all interested users.

Special features of the service include the ability to upload content in tabular format (tsv files) and the ability to publish posts as a thread. In addition to these basic functionalities, more features will be developed in the future.

autodone replaces [autoChirp](https://github.com/DH-Cologne/autoChirp), which offered the same functionality for Twitter before the Twitter API and Twitter itself was massively restricted regarding free and ethical usage.
